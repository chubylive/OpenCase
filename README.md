Laser cuttable mini-itx case

Mini ITX wooden case
This project is aimed at creating an open source mini ITX pc case. It will be built with your choice of material. Preferably wood or acrylic. It would be designed to hold a two slot graphics card with various side panels to accommodate for different card fan placements. It will be able to hold an ATX power supply. First version would shoot for a water cooling solution but it should be easy to adapt it to air cooled.


Why this project? 
Gaming mini ITX case are stupid expensive! And they should not be! So letâ€™s make on that is limited by only our imagination and laser cutters.
